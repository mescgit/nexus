**Nexus Core: Colony Manager - Development Roadmap**

---

**PHASE 1: CORE INFRASTRUCTURE**

1. **Basic Game State Setup**

   * App bootstrapping, game state management
   * ECS scaffolding for resources and components

2. **Resource & Power Systems**

   * Resource types: Ferrocrete, Silica, Food, Power
   * Extractors generate resources, require power
   * Power Grid: Operations Hub, Power Relay mechanics

3. **Construction System**

   * Building placement UI
   * Placement validation: space, terrain, cost, power reach
   * Entity spawning: tagged building types

---

**PHASE 2: POPULATION & SERVICES**

4. **Population System**

   * PopulationResource tracks: total pop, capacity, food, happiness
   * Growth logic: needs food, housing, services, happiness
   * Food consumption loop

5. **Housing & Food**

   * Basic Dwelling: adds housing capacity
   * Bio-Dome: produces Nutrient Paste

6. **Service Coverage System**

   * Radius-based influence: healthcare, security, education
   * Buildings: Wellness Post, Security Station, Education Node
   * UI: hover to visualize coverage zones

7. **Happiness System**

   * Global and sector happiness tracked
   * Factors: food supply, housing, service access, crowding
   * Affects growth rate, future events, worker efficiency

---

**PHASE 3: RESEARCH & PROGRESSION**

8. **Research System**

   * Unlocks new building types, upgrades, efficiency
   * Requires Research Institute
   * UI: tech tree panel, branching options

9. **Development Phases**

   * DP1: Basic Infrastructure
   * DP2: Advanced Industry
   * DP3: Specialization / Legacy structures
   * Gates building visibility & global events

10. **Legacy System**

    * High-tier buildings (e.g., Genesis Monument)
    * Require massive resources & full civic development
    * Optional prestige or victory mechanic

---

**PHASE 4: UI & TUTORIALS**

11. **Tablet UI Theme**

    * Responsive screen layout, screen switching
    * Panels: Dashboard, Research, Build, Stats

12. **Tooltip Tutorial System**

    * TooltipStep resource list
    * Triggered guidance based on game state
    * Highlights UI elements dynamically

13. **Game Flow Polish**

    * Alert system: civic problems, power outage, resource cap
    * Onboarding: first hour flow, unlocks and guidance
    * SFX / visual polish for feedback

---

**FUTURE / OPTIONAL**

* Procedural maps
* Crisis events: fires, disease, rebellion
* Economic trade system
* Citizen detail view / simulation
* AI Governor automation mode
