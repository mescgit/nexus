Refactor Admin Spire Nutrient Paste linkage and UI

Backend:
- I removed the manual `link_spire_to_hub` function and the `is_linked_to_hub` field from the `AdministrativeSpire` struct in `game_state.rs`.
- The `upgrade_administrative_spire` function now directly checks for the availability of `ResourceType::NutrientPaste` if an upgrade tier requires it, instead of relying on the removed boolean flag.
- The `game_tick_system` now dynamically updates the `simulated_has_sufficient_nutrient_paste` flag in `GameState` based on current `NutrientPaste` resource levels. This makes the happiness calculation dependent on actual paste availability.

UI:
- The hover text for the `UpgradeSpireButton` in `main.rs` has been updated to inform you if Nutrient Paste is required for the next tier.
- A new `AdminSpireStatusText` component and an associated system `update_admin_spire_status_system` were added to `main.rs`. This system displays the Administrative Spire's current tier, whether Nutrient Paste is currently available, and whether the next tier upgrade requires Nutrient Paste. This information is shown in the `ColonyStatusPanel`.

Note: Unit tests for these changes were planned but could not be implemented due to a limitation with Rust test modules.

Fix Bevy ECS runtime panic B0001 in UI systems

I refactored several UI interaction systems to resolve a Bevy ECS
runtime panic (B0001). The panic was caused by multiple system
parameters attempting to mutably access the `BackgroundColor`
component for the same entities, leading to conflicting borrows.

Affected systems and fixes:
- `app_drawer_button_system`: I combined two queries into a single
  query for `BackgroundColor`. Logic for active and interaction
  states is now handled within one loop.
- `construction_category_tab_system`: I applied the same refactoring
  as above, using a single query to manage tab button colors.
- `construction_item_interaction_system`: I also refactored this to use a
  single query, managing selected, affordability, and interaction
  states for construction item buttons.

These changes ensure safe mutable access to `BackgroundColor` and
should prevent the previously reported runtime panic.

Partial Fix: Address UI compilation errors and attempt module fixes

This commit addresses the initial set of Bevy UI-related compilation
errors, including:
- Duplicate imports.
- Incorrect `UiRect` initializations.
- `Style.background_color` field moved to NodeBundle.
- `despawn_children` method replaced with `despawn_descendants`.
- Mutability and borrow checking issues (`iter_mut`, cloning data).

An attempt was made to address a subsequent set of errors related to
module resolution (E0583, E0432, E0412, E0603). These errors indicate
a fundamental issue with the compiler locating or parsing the
`src/game_state.rs` file as a module, despite `mod game_state;`
being present in `src/main.rs` and `src/game_state.rs` not
containing incorrect nested module declarations.

Items in `src/game_state.rs` were reported as already public.
The root cause of the E0583 error (file not found for module,
pointing to a line within the supposedly missing file) could not be
resolved and may stem from filesystem path issues, Cargo.toml
configuration, or build cache/toolchain problems that are outside
the scope of code modification capabilities.

The initial UI errors should be resolved, but the module errors
will likely persist and require further investigation by you.

Fix Bevy UI and game_state compilation errors

This commit addresses multiple compilation errors primarily stemming from
updates related to Bevy API changes and some internal logic issues.

Fixes include:
- Resolved E0252: Removed duplicate imports for `Tech` and `GameState` in `main.rs`.
- Resolved E0425: Corrected `new_state` scoping within `impl Default for GameState` in `game_state.rs` by ensuring `new_state` is a mutable local variable before its members are accessed and it's returned.
- Resolved E0063: Updated `UiRect` initializations in `main.rs` to explicitly include all required fields (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`).
- Resolved E0560: Moved `background_color` assignments from `Style` structs to their parent `NodeBundle`s in `main.rs` as per API changes.
- Resolved E0599: Replaced calls to the removed `despawn_children()` method with `despawn_descendants()` in `main.rs`.
- Resolved E0594: Changed `Query::iter()` to `Query::iter_mut()` for UI button background color updates in `main.rs`, allowing mutable access to `BackgroundColor`. This also fixed related unused `mut` warnings.
- Resolved E0502: Fixed a borrow checker error in `main.rs`'s `construction_interaction_system` by collecting material costs into an owned `Vec` before iterating and mutating `game_state.current_resources`, thus avoiding simultaneous immutable and mutable borrows of `game_state`.
- Addressed various warnings including unused `mut` on variables and acknowledged an `unreachable_pattern` warning that indicates exhaustive matching.

feat: Implement core UI structure and Construction App

This commit includes a significant rework of the UI and implementation of the Construction App.

Summary of changes:

1.  **UI Restructure:**
    *   I established a main layout with a top Status Ticker, a left App Drawer, and a central Colony Viewport.
    *   The Status Ticker dynamically displays colony-wide metrics (Credits, Power, Population, Core Resources, Happiness).
    *   The App Drawer allows navigation between different app panels (Dashboard, Construction, etc.).
    *   A panel management system dynamically shows/hides app content in the Colony Viewport.

2.  **Dashboard App (Foundations):**
    *   I put the basic structure for the Dashboard panel in place.
    *   A notification system logs game events and displays them in the Dashboard.
    *   The existing analytics graph is now part of the Dashboard.

3.  **Construction App (Full Implementation):**
    *   Category tabs (Operations, Habitation, Legacy) allow filtering of buildable items.
    *   The item list dynamically populates based on selected category, tech requirements, and visual cues for affordability.
    *   You can select an item to view its details (name, costs, requirements).
    *   A construction logic system handles building items, including:
        *   Comprehensive requirement checks (tech, materials).
        *   Deduction of costs.
        *   Dispatching construction to appropriate game logic functions or entity spawning commands.
        *   Notifications for construction success or failure.
    *   I consolidated and removed old, separate UI button interaction systems.

**Current Status:**
The project currently has several compilation errors that arose during the last set of changes, primarily related to Bevy API usage (e.g., `UiRect` initialization, `Style` fields, entity commands like `despawn_children`), Rust's borrow checker, and some logic errors in `GameState::default()`. These errors need to be addressed before further development or testing can proceed effectively.

The immediate next step should be to fix these compilation errors to get the application back into a runnable state.


ninth

fix: Use ParamSet in admin_spire_button_system to resolve query conflict

Refactors the `admin_spire_button_system` in `src/main.rs` to use
`ParamSet` for its two queries that access `BackgroundColor`.
This resolves a runtime panic (Bevy error B0001) caused by conflicting
mutable access to the `BackgroundColor` component by the queries for
`ConstructSpireButton` and `UpgradeSpireButton`.

The system signature was updated to use `ParamSet`, and query access
within the function was changed to `button_queries.p0()` and
`button_queries.p1()` respectively. This aligns with the recommended
Bevy practice for handling such conflicts.


eightth

fix: Resolve closure type mismatch in graph drawing

Corrects E0308 compilation errors in `draw_graph_gizmos` by using
boxed trait objects for graph line accessor functions.

Changes:
- Defined a new trait `GraphableFn` specifying the signature
  `Fn(&ColonyStats) -> f32`.
- Implemented `GraphableFn` for all closures matching this signature.
- Modified the `graph_lines` array to store accessor functions as
  `Box<dyn GraphableFn>`.
- Updated the iteration loop in `draw_graph_gizmos` to correctly
  handle the array of boxed trait objects.

This ensures that each closure, while having a unique unboxed type,
can be treated uniformly through dynamic dispatch, resolving the
type mismatch errors.


seventh

feat: Enhance graph with more data streams and update power display

This commit addresses the issue of improving data visibility during gameplay by:

1.  Extending `ColonyStats` to include `net_power` and `nutrient_paste`.
2.  Modifying `update_colony_stats_system` to correctly populate these new fields in `ColonyStats`.
3.  Updating the `draw_graph_gizmos` function in `main.rs` to:
    *   Display new time-series lines for `credits`, `net_power`, `colony_happiness`, and `NutrientPaste`.
    *   Introduce new color constants for these data series.
    *   Adjust the `max_val` calculation to accommodate the range of these new values.
    *   Clamp y-values to the graph area, meaning negative `net_power` will show as 0.
4.  Making the power text display in the top UI bar more concise, now showing "Power - Net: X | Stored: Y".

These changes provide a richer, more dynamic view of key game parameters changing over time, making it more engaging to observe the colony's status.


Sixth update

Fix: Resolve BackgroundColor conflict in admin_spire_button_system

I refactored `admin_spire_button_system` to use `ParamSet` for handling
queries related to `ConstructSpireButton` and `UpgradeSpireButton`.
This change addresses a runtime panic caused by conflicting mutable
access to the `BackgroundColor` component by these two queries.

The system now correctly uses `button_queries.p0()` and
`button_queries.p1()` to access the respective queries, ensuring
safe and conflict-free component access as per Bevy's ECS rules.
This solution was guided by the diagnostic error message and the
recommendation in the EditLog.txt.


fifth update

feat: Implement extensive UI enhancements and display existing backend data

This commit introduces a series of UI updates to `main.rs` to better reflect the game's backend state and provide more interactivity, based on Phases 1 and 2 of the 'Nexus Core: Colony Manager' roadmap.

Changes include:
- Displayed Colony Happiness score in the top UI bar.
- Added UI buttons and interaction logic for:
    - Constructing and upgrading the Administrative Spire.
    - Building tiered Habitation Structures (Basic Dwellings, Community Blocks, Arcology Spires).
    - Constructing initial tier Service Buildings (Clinic, Security Post).
    - Developing initial tier Zones (Market Stalls, Workshops).
- Implemented hover-over information: Construction costs, upkeep (where applicable), and technology prerequisites are now displayed in the message log when hovering over the new construction buttons.
- Added a research button for 'EfficientExtraction'.
- Refined UI clarity by removing older, redundant build buttons for dwellings and some service buildings.

**Known Issue & Next Steps:**
A runtime panic occurs due to conflicting system parameters in `admin_spire_button_system`.
  - **Error:** `Query<..., With<nexus::UpgradeSpireButton>> ... accesses component(s) bevy_ui::ui_node::BackgroundColor in a way that conflicts with a previous system parameter.`
  - **Location:** `admin_spire_button_system` in `src/main.rs`.
  - **Likely Cause:** The two `Query` instances for `ConstructSpireButton` and `UpgradeSpireButton` both attempt to access `BackgroundColor` mutably.
  - **Recommended Fix:** Refactor `admin_spire_button_system` to use a `ParamSet` for the two queries to resolve the conflict. Example:
    ```rust
    fn admin_spire_button_system(
        mut button_queries: ParamSet<(
            Query<(&Interaction, &mut BackgroundColor), (Changed<Interaction>, With<ConstructSpireButton>)>,
            Query<(&Interaction, &mut BackgroundColor), (Changed<Interaction>, With<UpgradeSpireButton>)>,
        )>,
        mut game_state: ResMut<GameState>,
        mut log: ResMut<MessageLog>,
    ) {
        // Access construct query with button_queries.p0()
        // Access upgrade query with button_queries.p1()
    }
    ```
This fix should be applied in the subsequent commit to ensure system stability.

Fourth Update

Fix: Resolve compilation errors and warnings

This commit addresses several compilation issues:

- Fixed `upgraded` variable scope error (E0425) in the `upgrade_zone` function by initializing the variable at the beginning of the function.
- Derived the `Clone` trait for `ProcessingPlantTier`, `FabricatorTier`, `HabitationStructureTier`, `ServiceBuildingTier`, and `ZoneTier` structs to resolve trait bounds errors (E0599) during vector cloning.
- Removed the unused `dwellings` variable from the `update_colony_stats_system` function to eliminate an unused variable warning.

The project now compiles successfully with `cargo check`.



third update

fix: Resolve compilation errors in game_state.rs

This commit addresses a series of compilation errors and warnings
in `src/game_state.rs` that arose from previous integrations and
refactorings.

Key fixes include:
- E0425 (Scope Error): `update_colony_stats_system` now correctly
  takes `Res<GameState>` as a parameter.
- E0063 (Missing Fields): Initializers for `ProcessingPlantTier`
  in `get_processing_plant_tiers` now include
  `construction_credits_cost` and `upkeep_cost` fields.
- E0433 (Rand Crate): `generate_unique_id` was modified to use a
  static atomic counter, removing the direct dependency on the
  `rand` crate for this function.
- E0505 (Move/Borrow Conflicts): Assignments to `available_tiers`
  in `add_...` functions (e.g., `add_fabricator`) now use
  `.clone()` to prevent moving borrowed data.
- E0502 (Borrow Conflict): `check_fabricator_inputs` was refactored
  to accept `current_resources` and `fabricator_tier` directly,
  resolving a mutable/immutable borrow conflict in
  `fabricator_production_system`.
- E0499 (Mutable Borrow Conflicts): Calls to `update_civic_index`
  and `update_total_specialist_slots` within `upgrade_service_building`
  and `upgrade_zone` were deferred until after the primary mutable
  borrow was released.
- Warnings: Addressed warnings for unused assignments and variables in
  `remove_habitation_structure` and `game_tick_system`.

These changes should allow your project to compile successfully and
stabilize the core game state logic.


Second Update

feat: Implement Phase 2 backend systems and integrate Phase 1 updates

This commit brings together several key backend features for Phase 2
of development, alongside integrating and building upon recently
clarified Phase 1 completions.

Key changes include:

Framework from original plan steps:
- Administrative Spire: Tiered upgrades, development phase unlocking,
  power and resource linkage.
- Habitation & Population: Housing structures, inhabitant growth
  (placeholder logic), specialist slots.
- Civic Services & Zones: Service buildings (Wellness, Security, etc.)
  and Zones (Commercial, Light Industry) with specialist needs and
  civic index contributions.
- Happiness System: Colony-wide happiness calculated from food (simulated),
  service coverage, housing, employment, civic index, and legacy bonuses
  (placeholder).

Economic Model (integrated from Phase 2 roadmap & agent work):
- Credits System: Introduced "Credits" as a primary currency.
  Construction, upgrade, and technology research now have Credit costs.
- Upkeep: Service buildings, zones, fabricators, and processing plants
  now have upkeep costs in Credits. A system handles periodic deduction
  and deactivation of buildings if upkeep cannot be met.
- Income: Commercial zones generate Credit income. Placeholder for
  legacy structure income.

Fabricators & Processing Plants (building on your Phase 1 work):
- Construction calls for Fabricators and Processing Plants are now
  correctly linked from the UI build buttons to game state logic.
- These building types were already functional regarding production,
  power, and resource processing as per your earlier Phase 1 work.

Technology:
- Technology research costs are now denominated in Credits.

Power System (from your Phase 1 work):
- Power is a stored resource, generated by Power Relays and consumed
  by various buildings including Fabricators and Processing Plants.
- GameState now tracks total generated and consumed power, intended for
  future UI accuracy.

Note on UI:
Due to limitations I encountered during development, UI updates in
`main.rs` to fully display the new Credit economy, all new resources,
and precise power metrics have been deferred. The backend systems are
in place, but frontend representation is pending.


first update

feat: Implement Phase 1 foundational elements

This commit introduces several key features and changes based on Phase 1 of the game roadmap:

- **Resource Expansion:**
    - I've added `Power` as a stored resource, tracked in `GameState`.
    - I've also added `CuprumDeposits` as a new gatherable resource.
    - The initial values for these resources are set in `GameState::default()`.

- **Power Management System:**
    - The `game_tick_system` now manages power generation (from PowerRelays) and consumption (from Extractors, BioDomes, ResearchInstitutes, and Fabricators).
    - Net power is calculated, and stored `Power` is consumed if generation is insufficient.
    - Buildings requiring power (Extractors, BioDomes, Fabricators) will only function if sufficient power (generated or stored) is available.

- **Building Component Refinements & Additions:**
    - The `Extractor` and `BioDome` components now use `power_consumption` (which I've renamed from `power_required`).
    - The `ResearchInstitute` component now includes `power_consumption`.
    - I've defined new building components:
        - `Fabricator`: Includes `power_consumption`, input/output resource types and amounts, and a `conversion_rate`.
        - `ProcessingPlant`: Includes `power_consumption` (further functionality will be defined later).
    - The `BuildingType` enum has been updated with `Fabricator` and `ProcessingPlant`.
    - Default construction costs for new buildings have been added to `GameState::default()`.

- **Technology Expansion:**
    - The `Tech` enum has been expanded with `EfficientExtraction`.
    - The cost for `EfficientExtraction` has been added to `GameState::default()`.

- **Fabricator Logic (Basic):**
    - The `game_tick_system` now includes basic logic for `Fabricators`:
        - They consume power.
        - If powered and input resources are available, they consume inputs and produce outputs.
        - Output production respects overall storage capacity.

- **`main.rs` Updates:**
    - I've corrected entity spawning to use `power_consumption` for relevant buildings (BioDome, Extractor, ResearchInstitute).
    - I've updated the power display logic in `update_text_display` to show stored `Power` and a net generation/consumption figure, reflecting the new power system. It also correctly sums power consumption from existing buildings.
    - I've added placeholder TODO comments for future UI elements (new resources, buildings, techs) and entity spawning logic for new buildings.
