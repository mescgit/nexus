**NEXUS CORE – COMBINED CITY-BUILDING MECHANICS (BASED ON MANKIND + TECHNICAL DESIGN)**

---

**GAME OVERVIEW**
Nexus Core: Colony Manager is a futuristic city-building simulation drawing inspiration from classic mechanics like the Mankind MMO and expanding them into a modern, modular system. Players manage a growing colony on an alien world, balancing power, resources, housing, population happiness, research, and civic services across multiple development phases.

**CORE SYSTEMS AND BUILDINGS**

**1. POWER & ENERGY**

* *Operations Hub*: Central power source. Required for basic operations.
* *Power Relay*: Extends power range to other buildings.
* **Dependencies**: All buildings (except Hub) require power to function.

**2. RESOURCE EXTRACTION**

* *Basic Extractor*: Produces Ferrocrete or Silica.
* *Advanced Extractor*: Later-game high-yield variant.
* **Resource Dependency Tree**: Power → Extractor → Resource → Storage

**3. STORAGE & LOGISTICS**

* *Storage Unit*: Increases global resource cap.
* *Transport Depot*: Improves efficiency, allows future trade.

**4. HOUSING**

* *Basic Dwelling*: Provides housing for citizens.
* *Habitat Pod*: Mid-tier housing.
* *Hab Complex*: Late-tier housing, higher density.

**5. FOOD PRODUCTION**

* *Bio-Dome*: Produces Nutrient Paste.
* *Agri-Tower*: Advanced food output structure.
* **Growth Dependency**: Food + Housing + Happiness = Population Growth

**6. SERVICES**

* *Wellness Post*: Provides basic healthcare.
* *Security Station*: Prevents unrest, improves happiness.
* *Education Node*: Unlocks advanced research, raises specialist efficiency.

**7. CIVIC HAPPINESS SYSTEM**

* Affected by:

  * Food availability
  * Housing crowding
  * Service coverage radius
  * Pollution (future mechanic)
* Influences:

  * Growth speed
  * Worker productivity
  * Unlocks / events

**8. SPECIALISTS**

* Citizens automatically become Specialists when free housing, food, and happiness requirements are met.
* Specialists are assigned to buildings that require advanced roles (e.g., Research Institute).

**9. RESEARCH SYSTEM**

* Requires: Research Institute + Specialists
* Branching tech tree that unlocks:

  * Efficiency upgrades
  * New building types
  * Unique colony enhancements (cloning, automation, terraforming)

**10. DEVELOPMENT PHASES (DP)**

* DP1: Infrastructure Era (housing, food, power)
* DP2: Civic Era (services, specialists, advanced extractors)
* DP3: Expansion Era (research, trade, large-scale buildings)
* DP4: Legacy Era (Genesis Monument, orbital uplink)

**11. LEGACY STRUCTURES**

* *Genesis Monument*: Endgame structure; requires:

  * Max pop
  * 100% happiness
  * Full research tree
  * Massive resources

**GAME MECHANICS & FORMULAS**

**Population Growth**

```text
Growth Rate = (Population * 0.01) * FoodFactor * HousingFactor * HappinessFactor
FoodFactor = available_food / (population * food_per_person)
HappinessFactor = happiness / 100
HousingFactor = (housing_capacity - population) / housing_capacity
```

**Happiness Calculation**

```text
Happiness = base + (service_coverage_bonus) - (crowding_penalty) - (starvation_penalty)
```

**Resource Production Rate**

```text
Rate = BaseRate * PowerModifier * SpecialistModifier * UpgradeModifier
```

**Research Unlock**

* Costs: time, specialists, resources
* Unlocks specific buildings and systems
* Can trigger phase progression

---

**UI & USER EXPERIENCE**

* *Tablet Interface*: Emulates in-game colony command device
* *Panels*: Build, Dashboard, Research, Status
* *Tooltips*: Context-aware tutorial popups triggered by in-game events
* *Alert System*: Power outages, unrest, food shortage, etc.

---

**FUTURE FEATURES**

* Procedural terrain and sectors
* Crisis system: fires, plagues, political unrest
* AI automation (Governor Mode)
* Multiplayer economy/trade overlays
