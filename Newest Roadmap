Nexus Core: Colony Manager - Development Roadmap (From Current State)

Objective: To build upon the established foundation, deepen the simulation's complexity, and deliver the full gameplay experience from a thriving metropolis to a lasting legacy.
Phase 1: Deepening the Simulation & Management

Rust Focus: Enhance UI interactions in main.rs to expose existing backend logic. Expand data-driven structures in game_state.rs for more complex economic gameplay.

Objective: To fully implement the core management loops for specialists and production, providing you with granular control over your colony's economy and workforce.

Key Tasks:

    Full Specialist Management UI Implementation:
        Rationale: The backend functions for assigning specialists to Fabricators, ProcessingPlants, and ServiceBuildings already exist, but the UI lacks the necessary controls. This is a top priority for unlocking deeper gameplay.
        Action Items:
            Create a "Manage Specialists" or "Building Staffing" panel, likely accessible from the Dashboard or by selecting an individual building.
            In this panel, display buildings that require specialist assignments.
            Implement UI buttons and logic in main.rs to call assign_specialists_to_fabricator, unassign_specialists_from_fabricator, and the equivalent functions for other building types.
            The UI must provide clear feedback on specialist capacity, current assignment, and the number of available general inhabitants who can be promoted to specialists.

    Tiered Construction & Upgrade UI:
        Rationale: The backend supports multiple tiers for Fabricators, ProcessingPlants, and other structures, but the construction UI currently only builds the initial tier.
        Action Items:
            Modify the update_construction_list_system in main.rs to display all available tiers for constructible buildings, not just a single entry.
            The UI should clearly label the tier (e.g., "Basic Fabricator," "Advanced Fabricator") and show its specific credit and resource costs.
            Implement a separate UI for upgrading existing buildings in place, likely integrated into the specialist management panel.

    Complex Production Chain Expansion:
        Rationale: The game currently has a flat economy (raw materials -> finished goods). To create strategic depth, multi-stage production is required as per the roadmap.
        Action Items:
            Define recipes in game_state.rs for intermediate components (e.g., ProcessedQuantium, RefinedXylos).
            Update the FabricatorTier and ProcessingPlantTier structs with recipes that consume these intermediate goods to create AdvancedComponents or other high-tech materials.
            Ensure the UI clearly displays these new resource requirements for construction and production.

Phase 2: The Path to the Stars

Rust Focus: Expand the Tech enum and research logic significantly. Implement complex game state modifiers based on LegacyStructure effects.

Objective: To build out the mid-to-late game progression, making the pursuit of advanced technology and monumental structures a central, rewarding objective.

Key Tasks:

    Full Technology Tree Implementation:
        Rationale: The current tech tree is a placeholder. A deep and branching tech tree is a core pillar of the strategy genre.
        Action Items:
            Greatly expand the Tech enum in game_state.rs with dozens of new technologies.
            Implement technologies that unlock higher-tier buildings (e.g., "Arcology Construction"), advanced production recipes, global efficiency bonuses, and new management capabilities.
            Overhaul the "Research & Development" UI in main.rs to display a branching tech tree, showing dependencies and unlockable features.

    Implement Unique Legacy Structure Effects:
        Rationale: The UI and basic data structures for Legacy Structures exist, but their powerful, game-altering effects are not yet implemented.
        Action Items:
            In game_state.rs, modify the game_tick_system and other core logic functions to check for the presence and tier of Legacy Structures.
            Implement their unique global bonuses, such as colony-wide happiness boosts, significant credit income, and modifications to population growth rates, as planned in the roadmap.

    "Director's Console" - Advanced Analytics V1:
        Rationale: To manage a complex colony, you need more than just a line graph. The roadmap envisions sophisticated data visualization to help you make informed decisions.
        Action Items:
            Enhance the "Analytics" panel on the Dashboard.
            Add data views for resource net flow (production vs. consumption) to identify future bottlenecks.
            Create a "Happiness" breakdown showing positive and negative contributors (e.g., "+10 from Wellness, -5 from Housing shortage").
            Implement a projection system to provide advisory warnings like, "At current consumption, power reserves will be depleted in 3 cycles."

Phase 3: Creating a Legacy

Rust Focus: Code-complete core features, focus on game balancing, player onboarding, and systems for long-term replayability.

Objective: To polish the game into a complete and engaging experience, ensuring it is approachable for new players and offers lasting challenges for veterans.

Key Tasks:

    Player Onboarding & Guidance:
        Rationale: The game's complexity requires a system to guide new players.
        Action Items:
            Implement a Tutorial System, potentially using the existing notification system to create a script of guided objectives that walks the player through the "First Hour" experience.
            Create a Contextual Help System or in-game encyclopedia ("Nexuspedia") that can be accessed from the UI to explain what each building, resource, and gameplay mechanic does.

    End-Game Content: Apex Technologies:
        Rationale: The game needs a satisfying conclusion to the research tree, providing a powerful final goal.
        Action Items:
            Implement the final tier of the LegacyStructure.
            Once built, unlock the "Apex Technologies" in the research UI. These should be extremely expensive, long-term research goals that provide significant, game-changing bonuses.

    Comprehensive Game Balancing:
        Rationale: With all systems in place, a full balancing pass is required to ensure the game is challenging but fair.
        Action Items:
            Tune all numerical values: construction/upkeep costs, resource generation rates, power consumption, research costs, and happiness modifiers.
            Playtest extensively to ensure a smooth progression curve from the early game to the end game.

    Replayability: "New Directive" System:
        Rationale: To encourage multiple playthroughs, a New Game+ system adds long-term value.
        Action Items:
            Design and implement the "New Directive" system.
            When starting a new game after a successful playthrough, allow the player to start with a small bonus, a new challenge, or a different starting location with unique properties.
